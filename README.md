# Phase-Locked-Loop

## Design of a low power frequency synthesizer using Phase Locked Loops in 45nm and 180nm technology

## Tool used: Cadence Virtuoso
## Blocks designed:
### XOR gate as Phase Detector 
### Loop filter using 2nd order RC low pass circuit
### Ring oscillator as Voltage Controlled Oscillator 
### D Flip flop circuitry as frequency divider
